# cbf_imgcif_dictionary
Repository for CBF/imgCIF dictionary

This is a draft of the new home repository for the 
CBF/imgcif dictionary which will have a master ddl2
version, a derived ddlm version, one or more html
versions for online use, and various documentation
files for use in ITVG and other places.

At the time of writing (27 Nov 2023), this is a work in 
progress from the dictionary being maintained as an html
master within the doc directory in the yayahjb/cbflib
github repository, with a ddlm version being created
in COMCIFS/imgCIF using James Hester's ddl_to_ddl.jl
tool,and prelinary ddl2/cif_img.dic and a preliminary
ddlm/cif)img 1.8.8 version sitting in this repository
for testing.
