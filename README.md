# cbf_imgcif_dictionary
Repository for CBF/imgCIF dictionary

This is a repository for the CBF/imgcif dictionary
which has a master ddl2 version, a derived ddlm 
version, one or more html versions for online use, 
and various documentation files for use in ITVG and other places.

A new structure for management of the repositories for
the cif_img dictionaries under the DIALs unbrella is under
development.

At the time of writing (4 July 2025) this is a work in 
progress from the dictionary being maintained as an html
master within the doc directory in the dials/cbflib
github repository.  DDL2, DDLm and html versions are
available both in the dials/cbflib github repository
and in this repository.  The duplication will be resolved
in the course of the reorganization.
